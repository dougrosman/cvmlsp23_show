    <!-- <p>So, for people like Nicole, and Emrys, who have their own sites, I'm not going to be integrating the hand navigation.</p>

    <p>Maybe I'll just settle for a pop-out info window that people can click on or whatever to see more info about the work.</p>

    <p>or maybe, when the page loads, start with the wall text. and then the work will be visible.</p>

    <p>There can be pop-up buttons that appear when you put your hand up to navigate back to the homepage</p>

    <p>Honestly, I think I'll just rely on the mouse for both installations, since Chloe would need that to. There will still be hand navigation for the "info" and "back to home" stuff maybe...ugh, this is kind of a tough problem lol.</p> -->
